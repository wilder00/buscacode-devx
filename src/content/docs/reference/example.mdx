description: A reference page in my new Starlight docs site.

This is a text[^bignote].

Reference pages are ideal for outlining how things work in terse and clear terms.
Less concerned with telling a story or addressing a specific use case, they should give a comprehensive outline of what you're documenting.

## Further reading

- Read [about reference](https://diataxis.fr/reference/) in the Diátaxis framework

## Footnotes

[^bignote]: This is a reference that is used to correlate it to the document. It is best to read it alongside the paragraph it is used to help users gain a better understanding of the documentation.
